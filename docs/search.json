    "text": "Environmental Scientist specialised in Geographical Information Systems and worked as Research assitant at HeiGIT. My work focused on evaluating the impact of floodings on the road network connectivity and healthcare accessibility. During my Master (GIMA) I mostly worked in network analysis for my internship at HeiGIT using pgrouting (PostgreSQL) and object recognition based on foundation models such as SAM (Segment-Anything-Model) for my master thesis.\n\nShort bio\nBorn in Spain, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Environmental Sciences from the National University of Distance Education (UNED) in 2021 and started a two-year master’s degree in Geographical Information Management and Applications from the University of Utrecht in 2022 and finishing it in February 2025.\nDuring my undergraduate studies I changed the direction of my bachelor thesis from analysing samples in a laboratory to analyse data from a monitoring station in Edinburgh due to COVID19. It was then when I started using programming languages (R) and specific libraries (openair) to obtain large amount of data guided by Fernando Follos Pliego.\nAfter that, I started a joint MSc program of Geographical Information Management, spending time in each of the partners, University of Wageningen, ITC/UT Enschede, TU Delft and Utrecht University. I developed an interest for computer vision models and spatial analysis while working on my master thesis and internship respectively. I am extremely grateful to Manuel López Antequera for encouraging me to do this MSc and also for sharing me the contact of Christopher Beddow, who kindly recommended me to contact HeiGIT for my master internship.\nSupervised by Joao Valente we submitted a conference paper along the master thesis that was graded 8.5/10. Similarly, supervised by Marcel Reinmuth and Monika Kuffer working in the Geoinformation For Humanitarian Aid team in HeiGIT we submitted a full paper for the Agile 2025 conference obtaining a 9/10 in the master internship.\nThese experiences made me develop a great interest on transforming data into information by giving meaning and context to take better informed-decisions.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nHow to create a quarto website (link) from Sam Shanny-Csik\nHow to add a blog section in your website (link) from Sam Shanny-Csik\nHow to Consistent Branding with brand.yml (youtube) from Garrick Aden-Buie hosted by R for the Rest of Us\nHow to design a personal website from looking at the repository from Ella Kayle, Mickael Canouil and layout from Manuel López Antequera.\nHow to add interaction with the audience from Albert Rapp using utterances."

A Gantt Chart is a bar plot that displays project activities as bars against time (Meredith, Shafer, and Mantel 2017) used to manage the schedule not only during the planning process group 3, but also during controlling (Silvius et al. 2013). The scope base line contains the project deliverables that are considered when building the schedule model (Project Management Institute 2017). The main strength of this technique is the ability to clearly display the status of each activity at a glance (European Commission: Directorate-General for Digital Services 2023).\nBut is this relevant in the industry too?\nThe following quote is a main task in project controlling and reporting for a job advertisment from Siemens as Project Manager.\nThe next figure is an example taken from Snyder (2017) of a Gantt Chart\nThe goal of this quick fix is to automatize the creation of a similar bar plot from a spradsheet file in R and Python."
